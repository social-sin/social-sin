# 👋🏽 Hi, I’m @social-sin!
Kayla Lockwood is a multidisciplinary artist who explores the intersections of memory, domesticity, and loss, challenging the myth of home as a stable cornerstone of the “American Dream.” Working across new media—video, coding—and traditional techniques—textiles, ceramics, film, and sculpture—she interrogates the fragile illusions underpinning postwar ideals, nuclear family expectations, and capitalist promises of permanence. Through acts of iconoclasm such as distressing, cutting, and rebuilding, Lockwood transforms everyday objects into powerful vessels that reveal the tension between nostalgia’s polished surface and memory’s fractured truths.

Eager to push the boundaries of artmaking, Lockwood earned a BFA in Art & Technology from the University of Oregon and is currently completing her MFA at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Using her skills and knowledge, she has created multiple artistic personas—including Miss Identify and Social Sin—and founded numerous creative communities to unite like-minded artists. Guided by personal experiences of grief, her installations probe how gendered labor, care, and suppressed emotional work shape domestic life, prompting viewers to reflect on the myths of comfort, stability, and belonging embedded in the pursuit of home.
