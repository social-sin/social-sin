# üëãüèΩ Hi, I‚Äôm @social-sin!

I am a New Media Artist questioning the master narratives of art by celebrating cultural differences in the broad spectrum of human creativity and expression. I am currently based in the Pacific Northwest. I received my BFA in Art & Technology from the University of Oregon (2022). My studies included Digital Illustration, Creative Code Art, Emerging Technologies, and Contemporary Art History.

My work has been featured in the LaVerne Krause Gallery, Froyer Gallery, Washburn Gallery, Aperture Gallery, Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, and Lightbox NYC.

My professional interests include data information literacy; community outreach; art education; curatorial activism; access and inclusion within academic institutions; and using emerging technologies for creative expression.

# üêâ Artist Statement

I question the master narratives of art by celebrating cultural differences in the broad spectrum of human creativity and expression.

I represent myself and my artwork in two personas that exemplify my creative practice. One is Miss Identify which is a witty exploitation of the ambiguities of ‚Äúmisidentify,‚Äù encompassing my experiences of others misidentifying and erasing my multi-racial and bisexual identities. I utilize this practice as a love language to examine my internal relationships with my emotions and self-identity as well as my external relationships with friends and family through a nostalgic lens. These are works of emotional and physical relationships with myself and others, exploring topics of coping with grief and loss; rediscovering family histories; and reclaiming self-identity.

My other persona is Social Sin, which is based on my interest in examining the societal sins of discrimination and injustice through an institutional lens. I utilize this practice to build a stronger community through research, workshops, and community conversations. These works bring awareness of implicit biases, emphasize empathy and highlight the importance of maintaining self-identity through collaboration and non-confrontational dialogue.

These two personas overlap at a unique intersection of exploring the concept of death as a loss of identity and the practice of grief through personal anecdotes, rediscovery, and reclamation. This exploration establishes a relationship between personal and cultural histories as one‚Äôs self-identity is shaped by personal experiences and social expectations.
