# üêâ About me
  ## Artist Biography

Hi, my name is Kayla Lockwood and I am a New Media Artist. I grew up in Orange County, California, and currently conduct my art practice in Eugene, Oregon.

I am currently pursuing a BFA in Art and Technology, a major that combines new media practice and visual art theory, at the University of Oregon. I am also studying the history of contemporary art to further amplify my interest in curatorial activism, the practice of organizing exhibitions with the principal aim of ensuring that certain constituencies of artists are no longer excluded from the master narratives of art by celebrating cultural differences and the broad spectrum of human creativity and expression. Within the Art and Technology program, my concentrations are digital illustration and creative code art. Spring 2022 is when I am expected to graduate.

Beyond my university coursework, I have successfully started a freelance graphic design career; curated numerous exhibitions; hosted community workshops; and organized and participated in artist collectives within my community.

I have big dreams of pursuing a career in higher education, teaching students to develop creative practices and art education curriculums in creative code art and emerging technologies.

  ## Artist Statement

My work combines new media practice and visual art theory with curatorial activism. I use digital illustration and creative code art to question master narratives of art, and to celebrate cultural differences in the broad spectrum of human creativity and expression.

I represent myself and my artwork in two personas that exemplify my creative practice. One is Miss Identify which is a witty exploitation of the ambiguities of ‚Äúmisidentify,‚Äù encompassing my experiences of others misidentifying and erasing my multi-racial and bisexual identities. I utilize this practice as a love language to examine my internal relationships with emotions and self-identity as well as my external relationships with family and friends through a variety of mediums such as photography, digital illustration, communication design, and creative computing. These works are works of emotional and physical relationships with myself and others.

My other persona is Social Sin, which is based on my interest in examining the societal sins of discrimination and injustice through an institutional lens. I utilize this practice to build a stronger community through research, workshops, and community conversations. These works bring awareness of implicit biases, emphasize empathy and highlight the importance of maintaining self-identity through collaboration and non-confrontational dialogue.

These two personas overlap at a unique intersection of exploring the relationships between personal and cultural histories as my identities are shaped by both my personal experiences and the social expectations of culture.
