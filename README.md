# 👋🏽 Hi, I’m @social-sin!

   Oregon-based New Media Artist focused on personal and community expressions. Extensive experience with Graphic Design, Digital Illustrations, and Creative Code Art.

# 🐉 About me

   I am a New Media Artist. I grew up in Orange County, California, and currently conduct my art practice in Eugene, Oregon.
   
   I represent myself and my artwork through different pen names. Miss Identify encompasses my experience of being misidentified by others and the erasure of both my mixed-race and bisexual identity. The work I create under another pen name, Social Sin, is specific to the examination of the societal norms of discrimination in my artwork.
   
   I am currently pursuing a BFA in Art and Technology, a major that combines new media practice and visual art theory, at the University of Oregon. I am also pursuing a minor in Art History to further amplify my interest in curatorial activism, the practice of organizing exhibitions with the principal aim of ensuring that certain constituencies of artists are no longer excluded from the master narratives of art by celebrating cultural differences and the broad spectrum of human creativity and expression. Here, I have concentrated on specializing in Digital Illustration and Creative Code Art. Spring 2022 is when I am expected to graduate.
   
   Beyond my university coursework, I have successfully started a freelance graphic design career; curated numerous exhibitions; hosted open studio workshops; and organized and participated in artist collectives within my community.
   
   I have big dreams of pursuing a career in Higher Education, teaching students to develop art education and creative practices in Creative Code Art and Emerging Technologies.
